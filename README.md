# Data-driven apps developed using the 'streamlit' python library

## Quick start

Create a Python virtual environment:
`python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`

Install all the requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Start the app on a local server through [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io):
`streamlit run main.py`

You can now view this Streamlit app in your browser!

## Deployed apps

Take a look at the current version of the apps [here](https://share.streamlit.io/lmiguelgato/streamlit-demos/main/main.py).

### Acknowledgments

The core ideas for this app were borrowed from [this](https://youtu.be/ZZ4B0QUHuNc) great series of tutorials.
