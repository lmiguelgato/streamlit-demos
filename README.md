# Data-driven app developed using the 'streamlit' python library

![Checks workflow](https://github.com/lmiguelgato/streamlit-demos/actions/workflows/checks.yml/badge.svg)

## Quick start

Create a Python virtual environment:
`python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`

Install all the requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Start the app on a local server through [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io):
`streamlit run main.py`

You can now view this Streamlit app in your browser!
